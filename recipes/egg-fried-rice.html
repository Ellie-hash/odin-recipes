    <h3>Egg fried rice—and fried rice in general, really—is a huge part of Asian cuisine.</h3>
    <p>We know how much Filipinos love rice, and for other Asian countries this is no different. From Thailand to India to Japan, each nation has their own version of fried rice that they know and love. </p>
    <p>Even the Philippines has its own different variants and renditions! Indeed, fried rice is a very generic term that houses a lot of cultures across different countries.</p>
